/**
 * Ransom-note lettering: cuts a string into per-character chips, each assigned one of a handful of
 * looks, so a heading reads as letters clipped from different magazines and pasted in a row.
 *
 * Two properties matter, and they pull against each other:
 *
 * 1. It must be STABLE. The same heading cuts identically on every render, or the page reshuffles
 *    per request and every visual snapshot flakes. So: hashed, never randomised.
 * 2. Every look must actually appear. Hashing each letter independently gives no distribution
 *    guarantee - "Your Playlists" dealt six blue chips and not one red, dropping the zine's loudest
 *    colour from the heading entirely.
 *
 * So letters are dealt from a shuffled deck rather than hashed one by one: each run of
 * RANSOM_VARIANTS letters contains every look exactly once, in a deterministically shuffled order.
 * That keeps the palette honest and stops any one look from clumping, while still reading as
 * hand-pasted rather than as a repeating pattern.
