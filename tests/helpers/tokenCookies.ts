/**
 * Token cookies shaped the way this app actually writes them.
 *
 * `expiry_date` is the field that matters and the one hand-written fixtures kept leaving out: it is
 * set on the code exchange and on every refresh, and the auth path reads it to decide whether a
 * token can be used as-is, needs refreshing, or has to be asked about. A fixture without it
 * describes a cookie that has never existed outside a test, and sends the code down a branch kept
 * only for cookies written before the field was stored.
