/**
 * The mutation ratchet (scripts/mutation-ratchet.mjs) is what stands between this repo and a test
 * suite that quietly stops testing. It had four bugs in a day, every one of them found by accident,
 * and every one the same shape: it reported success when nothing had been measured. A gate that
 * fails open is worse than no gate, because the green tick is believed.
 *
 * Its decisions are pure functions - data in, verdict out - and these are the tests for them. The
 * disk, git and stryker parts are the command handlers, which are not tested here: they are what
 * the CI job itself exercises on every run.
