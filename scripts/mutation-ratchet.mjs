/**
 * Mutation-score ratchet: a file may not become less well tested than it already is.
 *
 * Each file is compared against its own recorded score rather than a shared threshold. A single bar
 * high enough to be worth enforcing would block any edit to a file that is currently under it, for
 * reasons having nothing to do with the edit. Per-file means a weak file stays editable while a
 * well-tested one cannot quietly rot. Stryker's own `thresholds.break` is one global number: a file
 * losing fifty mutants is ~1% of the whole, so it would not notice.
 *
 * The decisions live in exported functions that take data and return verdicts, so that the thing
 * standing between this repo and a rotting test suite is itself tested (tests/unit/mutationRatchet).
 * Everything to do with disk, git and stryker stays in the command handlers at the bottom.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/mutation-ratchet.mjs check [--base origin/main]
 *       Mutate only the files changed against the base and fail if one scores below its baseline.
 *       Mutating everything runs the test suite once per mutant, which is too slow to sit in front
 *       of a change; the files a change touches are the ones it can break.
 *
 *   node scripts/mutation-ratchet.mjs check-all
 *       Compare EVERY file in the last report against its baseline. The per-change check only looks
 *       at what a change touched, so it cannot see a file whose tests were weakened from elsewhere;
 *       this can.
 *
 *   node scripts/mutation-ratchet.mjs update
 *       Sweep everything and rewrite the baseline. Run after deliberately changing what is tested.
