/**
 * Types for the ratchet's exported decisions, so the tests calling them are type-checked.
 *
 * Hand-written: the script is plain JS and tsconfig.test.json cannot turn allowJs on, because that
 * makes tsc resolve the public/js client scripts, which are scripts rather than modules.
 *
 * These can drift from the implementation without tsc noticing. What catches that is
 * tests/unit/mutationRatchet.test.ts, which calls the real module: a signature that stops being
 * true fails there rather than passing quietly.
